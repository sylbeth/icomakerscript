# icomakerscript

These scripts (`png_to_ico.py` and `svg_to_ico.py`) use Python3 and the library `pillow` with version at least 8.4.0. To use `svg_to_ico.py` inkscape is also required and it needs to be on your path.

Both scripts accept arguments when being run. To check for them, run the script with the flag `-h`.

### FOR COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE SCRIPTS, THE PNGs NAMES MUST NOT CONTAIN . (except the .png). TO ENABLE THIS, USE THE FLAG -p.
